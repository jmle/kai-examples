    Stateful EJBs can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateful` annotation with a bean-defining annotation
     that encompasses the appropriate scope (e.g., `@ApplicationScoped`). `@Stateful` EJBs often translate to `@SessionScoped`
     beans (a scope which requires activating the `quarkus-undertow` extension), but the appropriate scope may differ based
     on your application architecture. Review your application's requirements to determine the appropriate scope.

     Note that it is recommended, as a good practice, to keep state external from the service in Quarkus.

    Any EJB method has container-manager transactions by default, with transaction attribute
     `REQUIRED` as a default (a transaction is started if one is not already in progress). Methods that were part of
     an EJB bean to be migrated to CDI must be annotated with `@Transactional`, or be marked as transactional
     in any other way (i.e, by annotating the class).
